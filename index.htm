		<h3><span>JEREMIAH</span> FABUL</h3>
		<p1>A jack of all trades at the age of 19. Honing versatile abilities, this college freshman from Batangas State University-Alangilan Campus 

has mastered the necessary skills to advocate for urgent <span>Climate Action</span>.</p1>
		<h2><span>Climate Action</span></h2>
		<p2>Climate change is real, and it's only a matter of time before catastrophic events come to annihilate our planet. The urge for climate 

action calls for a united alliance from people across the globe to bring at least the smallest change, a change that may eventually open doors for new 

opportunities and beginnings. Now is the time to go make that change and prevent the inevitable.</p2></div>

		<p>Changing from light mode to dark mode reduces the device's <span>power consumption</span> and make battery life last longer, leading to 

reduced amount of carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants in the atmosphere caused by energy generation.</p>

slide for a video presentation in which students have learned from. As a result, the used graphic art brought knowledge to my fellow students and made them be a part of a movement that aims to stop climate change.</p></div>

			<h1>CLIMATE ACTION</h1>
			<p>Climate pollutants have contaminated a great portion of our atmosphere, significantly affecting air quality, food, water, and 

economic security for much of the world. Taking urgent action regarding this matter should be prioritized if we humans, as habitants of the planet, want to 

secure a safe and healthy environment in the future. As an environmentalist myself, I have always advocated for the betterment and protection of our Mother 

Nature. I have always been concerned with our future as global warming worsens every year, hence my personal campaigns through social media against climate 

change. With the utilization of my skills and expertise, I hope to bring communites closer together to limit climate change by using my platform in reaching 

a wide audience.</p></div>
